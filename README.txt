This is a simple implementation of the ASP.Net MVC 3 15 minute movie tutorial, found at http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/movie-database/create-a-movie-database-application-in-15-minutes-with-asp-net-mvc-cs, implemented using NancyFx (http://nancyfx.org/)


Clone the repo, build, fire it up. It's not entirely RESTful, but neither is the Movie tutorial. MVC itself doesn't lend itself to be RESTful either. Anyway, I've tried to follow the web-parts as closely as possible, though I've used my own DB implementation and a pattern I'm used to called task-repository-command.
